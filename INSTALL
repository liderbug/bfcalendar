Install instructions: At least the way I did it. 

    Create a subdir "webcal"
    mv [dot]dbconnect.php to webcal/.dbconnect.php and configure
    Rename adminsub to .s0m3randOmStrIng  - [dot]some...
    Edit index.php - find "admin" and change href to [.some random string]
    Create you DB (from README) and install the 2 DB tables.
    Spend the next hour or two debugging what I've missed ...
