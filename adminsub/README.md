New & Edit

Hopefully new.php is self explanatory as is edit.php.  There are a couple of places 
in the code where you will have to [modify to you site].  IE in new.php the line that 
gets your htaccess login to populate the "created by" data.  Also there are 2 enums 
that you will have to reword for you location/use.
